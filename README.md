# Eye Exercise

This program was developed as part of the requirement for week 8 of MIT xPro Web Development With JavaScript course.

## Description

A set of eyes follow the cursor movement of the user. This is a fun little exercise that tracks movements of the mouse
and translates the coordinates and animates the eyeballs in relation to that.

Though this is a toy app, it highlights some key concepts in JavaScript, HTML, CSS and DOM manipulation techniques.

## How to Run

Download or clone the project to your local machine. Then you can run the program by following either options below.

- Option 1: Drag and drop the index.html file inside the src folder to the web browser.
- Option 2: Install a web server via npm like bsync or http-server. Then run the server inside the src folder to serve
  index.html.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

Some ideas for future improvements include:

- add more sets of eyes
- add facial features
- when mouse goes between eyes, make eyes crossed
